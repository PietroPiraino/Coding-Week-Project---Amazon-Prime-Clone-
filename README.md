# Coding-Week-Project---Amazon-Prime-Clone-

The project was realised as a coding week exercise for Edgemony Coding Bootcamp.
I was requested to create a clone of Amazon Prime homepage using the MovieDB API and the languages studied in the previous weeks of coding bootcamp.
Please, download the files and lauch the app using a live server extension.

Project details:

LAYOUT :  Amazon Prime Video style and fully responsive

PROJECT REQUESTS:

Request 1 / Includes a "Most rated" carousel in the Homepage

Request 2 / Includes a modal window displaying more information whilst hovering or clicking on a film.

Request 3 / The button "Generi" filters the films by category and displays a carousel for each.

Request 4 / It fetches films only, or in other words does not display TV series.

Request 5 / The modal window contains an average user rate meter in stars.


ADDITIONAL CONTENT:

1. The nav bar, similarly to amazon prime, contains open/close submenus.

2. Also the Nav bar contains a search icon which allows the user to filter the films by title.
